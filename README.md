# Todo-list
Project to learn full stack of sqlite database and react js frontend with flask api communications.
The SQLite database uses local memory to store data in the model form of an id, item title, and item content
The Flask api defines endpoints to allow CRUD actions from the database
The React frontend displays a page where users can add, edit, and delete items to the todo list
