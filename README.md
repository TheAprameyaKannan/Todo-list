Todo List

This project was created so that I could learn how to develop using a full stack
I used sqlite as an in memory relational database to story the todolist items 
I used python to communicate between the front end web server and the back end database as a CRUD API by defining flask endpoints
I used react, css, and html to create a UI that allows users to acess a responsive todo list
